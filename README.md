# We Are Cryptographers

A little collection of apps for experimenting with the material covered in our cryptography lessons. It is heavily indebted to Simon Singh's [The Black Chamber](https://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/_).

It is built using [Svelte](https://www.svelte.dev). To build and run, clone this repo then `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

The site is hosted at https://y5-cryptography.netlify.app/.
